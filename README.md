# Exploration-of-wines

## Introduction

In this project as the name suggests “Exploration Of Wines”, we are going to identify the different varieties of wines based on their descriptions by doing sentiment analysis and using some Machine Learning text related predictive models.

## Data set

I've taken data from the kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) The data consists of 13 fields which are described below.

1.) Country: the country where the wine is from.
2.) Description: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine’s taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
3.) Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from.
4.) Variety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Riesling)
5.) Points: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1–100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
6.) Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine.
7.) Province: the province or state that the wine is from.
8.) Region_1: the wine growing area in a province or state .
9.) Region _2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley).
10.) taster_name : Name of a person who taste it.
11.) taster_twitter_handle : twitter handle of a taster.
12.) title: A brief title of a wine.
13.) Winery: the winery that made the wine
